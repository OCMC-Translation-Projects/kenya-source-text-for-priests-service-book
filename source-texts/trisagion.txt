Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes.
The choir of Saints has found the source of life and the door of Paradise; may I too find the way through repentance; I am the lost sheep, call me back, O Saviour, and save me.
Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes.
I am an image of your ineffable glory, though I bear the marks of offences; take pity on your creature, Master, and with compassion cleanse me; and give me the longed-for fatherland, making me once again a citizen of Paradise.
Blessed are you, Lord, teach me your statutes.
Of old you formed me from nothing and honoured me with your divine image, but because I transgressed your commandment, you returned me to the earth from which I was taken; bring me back to your likeness, my ancient beauty.
Blessed are you, Lord, teach me your statutes.
