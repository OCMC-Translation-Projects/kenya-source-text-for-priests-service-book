THE DIVINE LITURGY OF OUR FATHER AMONG THE SAINTS JOHN CHRYSOSTOM

THE SERVICE OF PREPARATION
The Priest who is going to celebrate the divine Mystery must be reconciled beforehand with everyone, and have nothing against anyone; he must guard his heart, as far he can, from wicked thoughts; from the evening before he should remain abstinent, and be vigilant until the moment of the divine service.
When it is time, he enters the Church and, together with the Deacon, makes a bow to the Bishop’s stall and then three bows towards the east, in front of the closed Holy Doors, saying at each one:
CLERGY
God, cleanse me a sinner.
DEACON
Master, give the blessing.
PRIEST
Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
DEACON
Amen.
PRIEST
Glory to you, our God, glory to you.
Heavenly King, Advocate, Spirit of truth, present everywhere, filling all things, Treasury of blessings and Giver of life, come and dwell in us, cleanse us from every stain, and, O Good One, save our souls.
DEACON
Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. (three times).
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake.
Lord, have mercy. (three times).
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Our Father, in heaven, may your name be sanctified, your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, and do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
PRIEST
For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
DEACON
Amen.
PRIEST
Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us; for we sinners, lacking all defence, offer you, as our Master, this supplication: have mercy on us.
DEACON
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
Lord, have mercy on us, for in you we have put our trust. Do not be very angry with us, nor remember our iniquities. But look on us now, as you are compassionate, and rescue us from our enemies. For you are our God, and we are your people; we are all the work of your hands, and we have called on your name.
PRIEST
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Open the gate of compassion to us, blessed Mother of God; hoping in you, may we not fail. Through you may we be delivered from adversities, for you are the salvation of the Christian race.
DEACON
Lord, have mercy. (twelve times).
Then they go and venerate the Icons. As they kiss the icon of Christ they say:
We venerate your most pure icon, loving Lord, as we ask pardon of our offences, Christ God. For by your own choice you were well-pleased to ascend the Cross in the flesh, to deliver from the slavery of the enemy those whom you had fashioned; therefore with thanksgiving we cry to you: You have filled all things with joy, our Saviour, by coming to save the world.
As they kiss that of the Mother of God:
As you are source of compassion, grant us pity, Mother of God. Look on a people who have sinned, and show your power as always; for hoping in you we cry: Hail, as once Gabriel did, the chief Captain of the Bodiless Powers.
Then the icon of the Forerunner:
The just is remembered with praises; but for you, O Forerunner, the Lord’s testimony suffices. For you were revealed as more praiseworthy than the Prophets, because you were found worthy to baptise in running streams the One they had proclaimed. Therefore you struggled bravely for the truth with joy, and preached to those in Hell a God who had appeared in flesh, who takes away the sin of the world and grants us his great mercy.
As they venerate the icon of the Patron of the Church they say the appropriate troparion.
Having venerated the icons, standing again in front of the holy doors, they bow their heads, uncovered, and the Deacon says:
Let us pray to the Lord.
PRIEST
Stretch out your hand, Lord, from your dwelling on high, and strengthen me for your service which now awaits me, so that, standing uncondemned before your dread altar, I may offer the sacrifice without shedding of blood. For yours is the power and the glory to the ages of ages. Amen.
They bow their heads asking forgiveness of the people, and so go into the Altar, the Priest through the north door and the Deacon through the south, saying:
Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν τῷ πλήθει τοῦ ἐλέους σου εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου, προσκυνήσω πρὸς ναὸν ἅγιόν σου ἐν φόβῳ σου.
They make three bows before the holy Table, and kiss the holy Gospel and the holy Table.
The Priest and Deacon each takes his sticharion, faces east and makes three bows, saying each time:
God, cleanse me, a sinner and have mercy on me.
The Deacon then approaches the Priest, and says:
Master, bless the sticharion and orarion.
The Priest blesses them with the words:
Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
The Deacon kisses the Priest’s right hand and goes to vest.
Then the Priest blesses the cross on the back of his sticharion, kisses it and says:
Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
He blesses each vestment in turn and puts it on, saying,
My soul will rejoice in the Lord, for he has clothed me with a garment of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of gladness; he has placed a crown on my head as on a bridegroom, and adorned me with beauty as a bride.
Then the Priest, blessing each of his vestments and kissing the cross on them, puts them on, saying:
For the epitrachelion:
Blessed is God, who pours his grace upon his priests, Ὡς μύρον ἐπὶ κεφαλῆς τὸ καταβαῖνον ἐπὶ πώγωνα, τὸν πώγωνα τοῦ Ἀαρών, τὸ καταβαῖνον ἐπὶ τὴν ᾤαν τοῦ ἐνδύματος αὐτοῦ.
For the orarion:
DEACON
Whoever wishes to be great among you, shall be your servant.
For the girdle:
Blessed is God, Ὁ Θεὸς ὁ περιζωννύων με δύναμιν καὶ ἔθετο ἄμωμον τὴν ὁδόν μου·
For the right cuff:
Your right hand, Lord, has been glorified in strength; your right hand, Lord, has shattered enemies, and by the greatness of your glory you have crushed the adversaries.
For the left cuff:
Αἱ χεῖρές σου ἐποίησάν με καὶ ἔπλασάν με· συνέτισόν με καὶ μαθήσομαι τὰς ἐντολάς σου.
For the epigonation, if the Priest has the right to wear it:
Περίζωσαι τὴν ρομφαίαν σου ἐπὶ τὸν μηρόν σου, δυνατέ, τῇ ὡραιότητί σου καὶ τῷ κάλλει σου. Καὶ ἔντεινον καὶ κατευοδοῦ καὶ βασίλευε ἕνεκεν ἀληθείας καὶ πρᾳότητος καὶ δικαιοσύνης, καὶ ὁδηγήσει σε θαυμαστῶς ἡ δεξιά σου.
For the phelonion:
Οἱ ἱερεῖς σου, Κύριε, ἐνδύσονται δικαιοσύνην, καὶ οἱ ὅσιοί σου ἀγαλλιάσει ἀγαλλιάσονται.
For the pectoral Cross, if the Priest has the right to wear it:
If someone wishes to come after me let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
Then they both wash their hands, saying the Psalm:
Νίψομαι ἐν ἀθῴοις τὰς χεῖράς μου καὶ κυκλώσω τὸ θυσιαστήριόν σου, Κύριε, Τοῦ ἀκοῦσαί με φωνῆς αἰνέσεώς σου καὶ διηγήσασθαι πάντα τὰ θαυμάσιά σου. Κύριε, ἠγάπησα εὐπρέπειαν οἴκου σου καὶ τόπον σκηνώματος δόξης σου. Μὴ συναπολέσῃς μετὰ ἀσεβῶν τὴν ψυχήν μου καὶ μετὰ ἀνδρῶν αἱμάτων τὴν ζωήν μου, Ὧν ἐν χερσὶν ἀνομίαι, ἡ δεξιὰ αὐτῶν ἐπλήσθη δώρων. Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν ἀκακίᾳ μου ἐπορεύθην· λύτρωσαί με καὶ ἐλέησόν με. Ὁ πούς μου ἔστη ἐν εὐθύτητι· ἐν ἐκκλησίαις εὐλογήσω σε, Κύριε.
The Deacon, if there is one, if not, the Priest himself, goes to the Prothesis and prepares the sacred Vessels, placing the Paten on the left and the Chalice on the right. The Priest, wearing all his priestly vestments, goes to the Prothesis.
Then they make three bows before the Prothesis, saying each time:
God, cleanse me, a sinner and have mercy on me.
Then the Priest, raising the Prosphora and the Lance level with his forehead, says:
You redeemed us from the curse of the law by your precious blood; nailed to the Cross and pierced by the lance, you became a source of immortality for all. Our Saviour, glory to you.
DEACON
Master, give the blessing.
PRIEST
Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
Then the Priest, taking a prosphora in his left hand and the Lance in his right, makes the sign of the Cross three times over the seal with the Lance, saying each time:
In remembrance of our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ (three times).
Then the Priest thrusts the Lance into the right-hand side of the seal, beside the letters IC.NI, and says:
Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter.
As he cuts along the left side, that is beside the letters XC.KA:
And as an unblemished lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he does not open his mouth.
As he cuts along the upper side:
In his humiliation judgement was denied him.
As he cuts along the lower side:
Who will declare his generation?
DEACON
Then the Priest, thrusting the lance into the right hand side of the prosphora, takes out the Lamb, saying:
For his life is taken away from the earth.
He lays the Lamb inverted (with the seal downward) on the paten.
DEACON
Sacrifice, Master.
The Priest cuts it crosswise on the underside, but taking care to leave the seal intact, and says:
The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, is sacrificed for the life and salvation of the world.
He turns the Lamb over so that the seal is uppermost.
DEACON
Pierce, Master.
The Priest pierces the seal with the Lance on the right side, immediately below the letters IC, and says:
One of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance, and at once there came out blood and water; and he who saw it has borne witness, and his witness is true.
The Deacon pours sufficient wine and water into the Chalice, saying first to the Priest:
Bless, Master, the holy union.
The Priest blesses them saying:
Blessed is the union of your holy things, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
And he covers the chalice for the moment with one of the covers.
Taking another prosphora, he says:
In honour and memory of our most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary; at whose prayers, Lord, accept this sacrifice at your altar above the heavens.
Cutting the particle for the Mother of God, he places it to the right of the Lamb, near the middle, saying:
Παρέστη ἡ βασίλισσα ἐκ δεξιῶν σου ἐν ἱματισμῷ διαχρύσῳ περιβεβλημένη, πεποικιλμένη.
Then, taking the same, or a third, prosphora, he cuts smaller particles for the nine ranks of the Saints, and places them on the paten, to the left of the Lamb, that is to the priest’s right hand, in three rows or portions,
so starting the first rank, saying:
1. In honour and memory of the great Captains, the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, and of all the Bodiless Powers of heaven.
And taking a second particle he places it below the first, saying:
2. Of the honoured and glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist, John; of the holy, glorious Prophets Moses and Aaron, Elias, Elissaios, David, son of Jesse, the Three Holy Youths, the prophet Daniel and all the holy Prophets.
*******************************************
Or, according to some ancient Orders:
1. In honour and memory of the honoured and glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist, John.
2. Of the holy, glorious Prophets Moses and Aaron, Elias, Elissaios, David, son of Jesse, the Three Holy Youths, the prophet Daniel and all the holy Prophets.
*******************************************
And taking a third particle he places it below the second, thus completing the first rank, saying:
3. Of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles Peter and Paul, the Twelve, the Seventy and all the holy Apostles.
And taking a fourth particle he places it next to the first, so starting the second rank, saying:
4. Of our Fathers among the Saints, great Hierarchs and Ecumenical Teachers, Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom, Athanasios and Cyril, Nicolas of Myra, and all holy hierarchs.
And taking a fifth particle he places it below the fourth, saying:
5. Of the holy Protomartyr and Archdeacon Stephen; of the holy glorious Great Martyrs, George, the Victorious, Demetrios Myrovlites, Theodore the Recruit and Theodore the General; of the holy, glorious Protomartyr and Equal of the Apostles, Thekla, of Barbara, Katherine, Marina and Paraskevi; and of all holy martyrs.
And taking a sixth particle he places it below the fifth, so completing the second rank, saying:
6. Of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers, Antony the Great, Efthymios, Savvas, Onouphrios, Peter and Athanasios of Athos; of our Venerable and God-bearing Mothers, Pelagia, Theodosia, Euphrosyne, Mary of Egypt; and of all holy ascetics.
After this, taking a seventh particle, he places it beside the fourth, so staring the third rank, saying:
7. Of the holy Wonderworkers and Unmercenary Physicians, Cosmas and Damian, Cyrus and John, Panteleimon and Hermolaos, and all holy Unmercenary Saints.
Then he takes an eighth particle and places it below the seventh, saying:
8. Of the holy and righteous Forebears of God, Joachim and Anne, of N. (the Saint of the day), whose memory we celebrate, and of all the Saints, at whose intercessions visit us, O God.
After this he takes the ninth particle and places it below the eighth, so completing the third rank, saying:
9. Of our Father among the Saints John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople (or Of our Father among the Saints Basil the Great, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia).
Then, from the same or another prosphora, he cuts particles for the living, and places them on the paten below the Lamb, saying:
Remember, Master, Lover of mankind, every bishopric of the Orthodox, our Archbishop N., the honoured order of presbyters, the diaconate in Christ and every order of clergy, our brothers and fellow celebrants, priests and deacons, and the whole priestly and monastic order.
Then he commemorates the Bishop who ordained him, if he is still living, and then those of the living whose names he has, taking particles for each and saying:
Remember, Lord, N.
Then he cuts particles for the departed, placing them also below the Lamb, saying:
For remembrance and forgiveness of sins of the blessed founders of this holy house.
Then, from the same or another prosphora, he remembers the Bishop who ordained him, if he is no longer alive, and others of the departed, whom he wishes, by name, saying for each:
Remember, Lord, N.
Then he says:
And of all our fellow Orthodox who have fallen asleep in the hope of resurrection to everlasting life, in communion with you, Lord, Lover of mankind.
Likewise the Deacon also remembers those whom he wishes of the living and the dead.
Finally the Priest cuts a particle for himself, saying:
Remember also, Lord, me your unworthy servant, and pardon me every offence, both voluntary and involuntary.
The Deacon takes the censer and puts incense in it, saying to the Priest:
Master, bless the incense.
The Priest blesses the incense, saying:
DEACON
Make firm, Master.
The Priest censes the Star, the Deacon holding the censer, and places it on the Paten above the holy bread, saying:
Τῷ λόγῳ τοῦ Κυρίου οἱ οὐρανοὶ ἐστερεώθησαν καὶ τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις αὐτῶν.
DEACON
Make majestic, Master.
The Priest censes the first veil, in the same way as the Star, and places it over the Paten, saying:
Ὁ Κύριος ἐβασίλευσεν, εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσατο. Ἐνεδύσατο Κύριος δύναμιν καὶ περιεζώσατο.
DEACON
Cover, Master.
And he covers the chalice for the moment with one of the covers.
Your virtue, O Christ, has covered the heavens, and the earth is full of your praise.
DEACON
Shelter, Master.
The Priest censes the large veil (the Aer), as before, and with it covers both the Chalice and the Paten, saying:
Shelter us in the shelter of your wings; drive away from us e­very enemy and adversary. Bring peace, O Lord, to our lives, have mercy on us and on your world, and save our souls, for you are good and the lover of mankind.
DEACON
Master, give the blessing.
Then the Priest takes the censer and censes the Offering three times, saying each time:
Blessed is our God, who has been thus well-pleased. Glory to you. (three times).
Each time the Deacon concludes:
Always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
And they both bow three times before the Offering. Then the Deacon takes the censer and says:
For the holy and sacred Offering of the precious gifts, let us pray to the Lord. Lord, have mercy.
PRAYER OF THE OFFERTORY
PRIEST
God, our God, who sent forth the heavenly Bread, the food of the whole world, our Lord and God Jesus Christ, as our Saviour, and Redeemer and Benefactor, to bless and sanctify us; bless this Offering, and receive it on your altar above the heavens. In your goodness and love for mankind be mindful of those who have offered it, and those for whom they have offered it; and as we celebrate your divine mysteries keep us without condemnation. For sanctified and glorified is your all-honoured and majestic name, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
After this he gives the Dismissal, saying:
Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you.
DEACON
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Lord, have mercy. (three times). Holy Master, bless.
PRIEST
(On Sundays: he who rose from the dead) Christ, our true God, through the prayers of his most pure and holy Mother, of our Father among the Saints John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople (Or: Basil the Great, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia), and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind.
DEACON
Amen.
After the Dismissal the Deacon censes the holy Prothesis. Then he goes and censes the Holy Table all round, crosswise, saying in a low voice:
With your body, O Christ, you were in the tomb, with your soul in Hades as God, in Paradise with the Thief, on the throne with Father and the Spirit, filling all things, yet yourself uncircumscribed.
And Psalm 50:
Ἐλέησόν με, ὁ Θεός, κατὰ τὸ μέγα ἔλεός σου, καὶ κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν σου ἐξάλειψον τὸ ἀνόμημά μου. Ἐπὶ πλεῖον πλῦνόν με ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνομίας μου, καὶ απὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας μου καθάρισόν με. Ὅτι τὴν ἀνομίαν μου ἐγὼ γινώσκω, καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία μου ἐνώπιόν μού ἐστι διὰ παντός. Σοὶ μόνῳ ἥμαρτον καὶ τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ἐποίησα, ὅπως ἂν δικαιωθῇς ἐν τοῖς λόγοις σου, καὶ νικήσῃς ἐν τῷ κρίνεσθαί σε. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἐν ἀνομίαις συνελήφθην, καὶ ἐν ἁμαρτίαις ἐκίσσησέ με ἡ μήτηρ μου. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἀλήθειαν ἠγάπησας, τὰ ἄδηλα καὶ τὰ κρύφια τῆς σοφίας σου ἐδήλωσάς μοι. Ραντιεῖς με ὑσσώπῳ, καὶ καθαρισθήσομαι, πλυνεῖς με, καὶ ὑπὲρ χιόνα λευκανθήσομαι. Ἀκουτιεῖς μοι ἀγαλλίασιν καὶ εὐφροσύνην· ἀγαλλιάσονται ὀστέα τεταπεινωμένα. Ἀπόστρεψον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου καὶ πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας μου ἐξάλειψον. Καρδίαν καθαρὰν κτίσον ἐν ἐμοί, ὁ Θεός, καὶ πνεῦμα εὐθὲς ἐγκαίνισον ἐν τοῖς ἐγκάτοις μου. Μὴ ἀπορρίψῃς με ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου σου καὶ το Πνεῦμά σου τὸ ἅγιον μὴ ἀντανέλῃς ἀπ' ἐμοῦ. Ἀπόδος μοι τὴν ἀγαλλίασιν τοῦ σωτηρίου σου καὶ πνεύματι ἡγεμονικῷ στήριξόν με. Διδάξω ἀνόμους τὰς ὁδούς σου, καὶ ἀσεβεῖς ἐπὶ σὲ ἐπιστρέψουσι. Ρῦσαί με ἐξ αἱμάτων, ὁ Θεὸς, ὁ Θεὸς τῆς σωτηρίας μου· ἀγαλλιάσεται ἡ γλῶσσά μου τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου. Κύριε, τὰ χείλη μου ἀνοίξεις, καὶ τὸ στόμα μου ἀναγγελεῖ τὴν αἴνεσίν σου. Ὅτι εἰ ἠθέλησας θυσίαν, ἔδωκα ἄν· ὁλοκαυτώματα οὐκ εὐδοκήσεις. Θυσία τῷ Θεῷ πνεῦμα συντετριμμένον, καρδίαν συντετριμμένην καὶ τεταπεινωμένην ὁ Θεὸς οὐκ ἐξουδενώσει. Ἀγάθυνον, Κύριε, ἐν τῇ εὐδοκίᾳ σου τὴν Σιών, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήτω τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλήμ. Τότε εὐδοκήσεις θυσίαν δικαιοσύνης, ἀναφορὰν καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα. Τότε ἀνοίσουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριόν σου μόσχους.
Meanwhile he censes the Sanctuary and, from the Holy Doors, the Icons the People, then re-enters the holy Altar and censes the holy Table once again and then the Priest, and puts the censer in its place.
   

PRELIMINARIES TO THE LITURGY
When the moment to start the Liturgy has come the Priest and Deacon stand together before the holy Table and the Priest says:
Heavenly King, Advocate, Spirit of truth, present everywhere, filling all things, Treasury of blessings and Giver of life, come and dwell in us, cleanse us from every stain, and, O Good One, save our souls.
Then they bow three times and say:
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace; good will among men. (three times).
Κύριε, τὰ χείλη μου ἀνοίξεις, καὶ τὸ στόμα μου ἀναγγελεῖ τὴν αἴνεσίν σου. (twice).
The Deacon bows his head to the Priest, and says to the Priest:
The Priest, placing his right hand on his head, blesses him, saying:
Blessed is our God. Always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
DEACON
PRIEST

Then the Priest kisses the holy Gospel and the Deacon the Holy Table and the Priest’s hand. He then goes out by the north door and stands in his usual place in front of the Holy Doors. Then he says in a loud voice:

And the Liturgy begins.

PRIEST
After the prayer the Priest and the Deacon say the Cherubic Hymn three times, as follows:
PRIEST
DEACON
For we are about to receive the King of all, invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Then the Priest, or Deacon, takes the censer and censes the Holy Table, the Sanctuary, the principal icons and the People, coming out a little from the holy Doors.
In a low voice he says, if it is Sunday,
Having seen the Resurrection of Christ...,
and Psalm 50, excluding the last two verses which begin, Do good, Lord, to Sion. If it is not a Sunday he says,
and then Psalm 50 as above. Then he enters the Sanctuary and puts away the censer. He comes with the Deacon in front of the Holy Table and they make three bows, and they say quietly troparia of compunction. They kiss the Antimension and the Holy Table, bow again and then turn to the people and bow to them, saying:
Forgive me, or similar words.
They go to the table of the Prothesis, and having made three bows they kiss the covered Holy Gifts, saying:
God, cleanse me a sinner. (three times).
Then the Deacon says to the Priest:
Master, lift up.
The Priest lifts the Aer and places it on the shoulders of the Deacon, saying:
Ἐπάρατε τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν εἰς τὰ ἅγια καὶ εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον. (Psalm 133:2)
Then he takes the covered Paten and places it with every care and reverence on the Deacon’s head, while he himself takes the Holy Chalice, likewise covered.
Ἀνέβη ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ἀλαλαγμῷ, Κύριος ἐν φωνῇ σάλπιγγος.
   

When the Singers reach the end of the first part of the Cherubic Hymn, the Deacon and the Priest come out from the north door of the Sanctuary, preceded by exapteryga, lights and incense, and pass through the north aisle and the middle of the Nave as they make the Great Entrance. As they process they proclaim, one after the other:
PEOPLE
Amen.
And they complete the Cherubic Hymn:
For we are about to receive the King of all, invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

The Priest and Deacon enter the Sanctuary.
The Deacon, stands to the right in front of the Holy Table and says to the Priest as he enters:
DEACON
And the Priest, as he enters, says to him:
May the Lord God remember your diaconate in his Kingdom, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
Then the Priest places the Chalice on the Holy Table, takes the Paten from the Deacon and places it to the left of the Chalice, saying:
The noble Joseph, taking your most pure Body from the Tree, wrapped it in pure linen with sweet spices and laid it for burial in a new grave.
Then he takes the covers from the sacred Paten and the Holy Chalice and lays them to one side on the Holy Table. He takes the Aer from the shoulders of the Deacon, holds it over the censer and lays it over the Chalice and Paten. Then he takes the censer and censes the Gifts three times, as the Deacon says:
PRIEST
Ἀγάθυνον, Κύριε, ἐν τῇ εὐδοκίᾳ σου τὴν Σιών, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήτω τὰ τείχη Ἰερουσαλήμ. Τότε εὐδοκήσεις θυσίαν δικαιοσύνης, ἀναφορὰν καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα. Τότε ἀνοίσουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριόν σου μόσχους. (Psalm 50:20-21)
He puts away the censer and says to the Deacon:

The Priest bows three times and kisses the Aer over the Gifts, saying in a low voice:
Κύριος στερέωμά μου καὶ καταφυγή μου καὶ ρύστης μου.
Likewise the Deacon, standing in his place, bows and kisses the Cross on his orarion. At a concelebrated Liturgy the Priests here exchange the Kiss of Peace, the senior saying:
Christ is in our midst.
to which the junior answers:
He is and will be.
If there is more than one Deacon they also exchange the Kiss with one another in the same way.
THE CREED
DEACON
PEOPLE
I believe in one God, * Father, Almighty,* Maker of heaven and earth,* and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord, Jesus Christ,* the only-begotten Son of God, * begotten from the Father * before all ages, * Light from Light, * true God from true God, * begotten * not made, * consubstantial with the Father,* through him all things were made. * For our sake and for our salvation * he came down from heaven, * and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit * and the Virgin Mary * and became man. * He was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate,* and suffered and was buried; * he rose again on the third day, * in accordance with the Scriptures, * and ascended into heaven * and is seated at the right hand of the Father. * He is coming again in glory * to judge the living and the dead, * and his kingdom will have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, * the Lord, * the Giver of life, * who proceeds from the Father, * who together with Father and Son is worshipped * and together glorified; * who spoke through the Prophets. * In one, Holy, * Catholic and Apostolic Church. * I confess one Baptism * for the forgiveness of sins. * I await the resurrection of the dead * and the life of the age to come. Amen.
Meanwhile the Priest lifts the Aer and waves it above the Gifts. At the words and ascended into heaven…, he kisses the Cross in the middle of it, folds it and puts it to one side with the veils.

It is truly right to call you blessed, who gave birth to God, ever-blessed and most pure, and Mother of our God. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word; truly the Mother of God, we magnify you.

PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION
As you go to receive Communion say the following verses to yourself:
See, to divine Communion I approach; My Maker, burn me not as I partake, For you are fire consuming the unworthy, But rather cleanse me now of every stain.
Then the following Troparion:
Of your mystical Supper, Son of God, receive me today as a communicant; for I will not tell of the Mystery to your enemies; I will not give you a kiss, like Judas; but like the Thief I confess you: Remember me, Lord, in your Kingdom.
Then again the following verses:
You see the deifying Blood: have fear. It is a coal consuming the unworthy. God’s Body deifies and nourishes me strangely; both my spirit and my mind.
And the following Troparia:
You have smitten me with longing, O Christ, and changed me by your divine love; but with your immaterial fire burn up my sins and count me worthy to be filled with delight in you, that as I leap for joy, O Good One, I may magnify your first and second Comings.
By St Cosmas the Melodist.
How shall I, the unworthy, enter among the splendours of your Saints? For if I dare to enter with them into the bridal chamber, my dress convicts me, for it is not a wedding garment, and I shall be bound and cast out by the Angels. Cleanse the stain of my soul, Lord, and save me, as you love humankind.
Then the following prayer:
Master, lover of humankind, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, do not let these holy Mysteries be for my condemnation because I am unworthy, but rather for the cleansing and sanctification of both soul and body and as a pledge of the life and kingdom to come. It is good for me to cleave to God, to place in the Lord the hope of my salvation.
And again:
Of your mystical Supper, Son of God, receive me today as a communicant; for I will not tell of the Mystery to your enemies; I will not give you a kiss, like Judas; but like the Thief I confess you: Remember me, Lord, in your Kingdom.
   

THANKSGIVING AFTER HOLY COMMUNION
Verses of Admonition.
Whenever you have had Communion Of the life-giving and transcendent gifts, At once give praise and offer heartfelt thanks, And from your soul say fervently to God: Glory to you, O God. Glory to you, O God. Glory to you, O God.
And immediately the prayers of thanksgiving.
Anonymous.
I thank you, Lord, my God, because you have not rejected me a sinner, but have counted me worthy to be a communicant of your Holy Things. I thank you, because you have counted me, the unworthy, worthy to share in your most pure and heavenly gifts. But, Master, Lover of mankind, who died for our sake and rose again, and gave us these your awe-inspiring and life-giving Mysteries, for the well-being and hallowing of our souls and bodies, grant that these gifts may bring me also healing of soul and body, the repelling of every adversary, the enlightenment of the eyes of my heart, peace of my spiritual powers, faith unashamed, love without pretence, fullness of wisdom, the keeping of your commandments, increase of your divine grace and the gaining of your Kingdom; that preserved through them by your sanctification, I may always remember your grace, and no longer live for myself but for you, our Master and Benefactor. And so, when I leave this present life in the hope of life eternal, I shall find everlasting repose where the sound of those who feast is unceasing, and the delight of those who see the ineffable beauty of your face is unbounded. For you are the true desire and the inexpressible joy of those who love you, Christ our God, and all creation hymns you to the ages. Amen.
By Saint Basil the Great.
Master, Christ God, King of the ages, and Creator of all things, I thank you for all the good things you have given me, and for Communion in your most pure and life-giving mysteries Therefore I pray you, O Good One, Lover of mankind: guard me under your protection and in the shadow of your wings; and grant that until my last breath I may share worthily and with a pure conscience in your holy things for forgiveness of sins and everlasting life. For you are the Bread of life, the source of sanctification, the giver of blessings; and to you we give glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
By Symeon Metaphrastes.
You who willingly give me your flesh for food, Who are a fire consuming the unworthy; Do not burn me up, my Maker; But penetrate the structure of my limbs, All my joints, my inner parts, my heart. Burn up the thorns of all my offences, Purify my soul and sanctify my mind. Strengthen my knees, together with my bones; Enlighten the five-fold simpleness of my senses; Nail down the whole of me with fear of you. Always protect, guard and keep me From every soul-destroying deed and word. Hallow me, purify me, bring me to harmony, And give me beauty, understanding, light; Show me to be your dwelling, the Spirit’s house alone, And no more the dwelling place of sin; That, by the entrance of Communion, Every evil-doer, every passion May flee from me, your house, as from a fire. As intercessors I bring you all the Saints, The companies of the Bodiless Hosts, Your Forerunner, the wise Apostles, And with them your most pure and holy Mother; Accept their prayers, O my compassionate Christ, And make your servant a child of light. For you alone are the hallowing of our souls, O Good One, and their brightness, And fittingly to you, as to our God and Master, We all give praise and glory every day.
Anonymous.
May your holy Body, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, bring me eternal life, and your precious Blood forgiveness of sins. May this Eucharist bring me joy, health and gladness; and at your dread Second Coming make me, a sinner, worthy to stand at the right hand of your glory, at the prayers of your all-pure Mother and of all your Saints. Amen.
Anonymous. To the Most Holy Mother of God.
All-holy Lady, Mother of God, the light of my darkened soul, my hope, protection, refuge, comfort, joy, I thank you, because you have made me, the unworthy, worthy to become a partaker in the most pure Body and precious Blood of your Son. But, O you who gave birth to the true Light, enlighten the spiritual eyes of my heart; you who bore the source of immortality, give life to me, who have been slain by sin; you the compassionate Mother of the merciful God, have mercy on me and give me compunction and contrition in my heart, and humility in my ideas, and release from the imprisonment of my thoughts. And count me worthy, until my last breath, to receive without condemnation the hallowing of the most pure Mysteries, for healing of soul and body; and grant me tears of repentance and thanksgiving, to praise and glorify you all the days of my life.
For you are blessed and glorified to the ages. Amen. (three times).
Then the Song of Symeon.
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel.
Trisagion etc.
Apolytikion of Saint John Chrysostom.
The grace which shone from your mouth like a torch of flame enlightened the whole earth; it laid up for the world the treasures of freedom from avarice; it showed us the height of humility. But as you train us by your words, Father John Chrysostom, intercede with Christ God, the Word, that our souls may be saved.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
Kontakion of Saint John Chrysostom.
You received divine grace from heaven, and through your lips you teach us all to worship one God in Trinity, venerable John Chrysostom, wholly blessed. Fittingly we praise you, for you are a teacher who makes clear things divine.

SERVICE OF THE ARTOKLASIA
1. At Vespers
When there is an Artoklasia, the loaves with wheat, wine and oil are placed in the centre of the Church; and, while the Chanters sing one of the troparia of the Liti of the Saint whose feast is being celebrated (if the feast has no Liti, the Apolytikion is sung), the Priest and Deacon come from the Sanctuary by the Holy Doors, with lights and incense, and take their stand in the middle of the Church.
When the troparion is finished:
DEACON
Have mercy on us, O God, in accordance with your great mercy, we pray you, hear and have mercy.
PEOPLE
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. And so after each petition.
DEACON
Also we pray for our Archbishop N.
Also we pray for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation, visitation, pardon and forgiveness of sins of the servants of God, the parishioners, members, wardens, benefactors of this holy church, and of his servants (and he commemorates the names of those who have offered the loaves) who celebrate this holy feast, and who offer these gifts.
Also we pray for the protection of this holy church, this city and every city, town and village from plague, famine, earthquake, flood, fire, sword, invasion by enemies, civil war and sudden death; and that our good God, who loves mankind, will be merciful, kindly and easily entreated, and turn away and dispel all wrath and disease stirred up against us, and deliver us from his just threat that hangs over us, and have mercy on us.
While this petition is being said, the Chanters sing
Lord, have mercy.
40 times (in groups of 10) and again 3 times.
DEACON
Also we pray that the Lord, our God, will hear the voice of supplication of us sinners, and have mercy on us.
PEOPLE
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
PRIEST
Hear us, O God, our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of those far off at sea; and have pity, have pity, Master, on our sins, and have mercy on us. For you, O God, are merciful, and love mankind, and to you we give glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
PEOPLE
Amen.
PRIEST
Peace to all.
PEOPLE
And to your spirit.
DEACON
Let us bow our heads to the Lord.
PEOPLE
To you, O Lord.
PRIEST
Most merciful Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, through the prayers of our all-pure Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary; by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross; through the protection of the honoured Bodiless Powers of heaven; through the intercessions of the honoured, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John; of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of the holy, glorious and triumphant Martyrs, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers and Mothers, (the Patron Saint of the Church), of the holy and righteous Forebears of God, Joachim and Anna, of Saint N. whose memory we keep today, and of all your Saints: make our supplication acceptable; grant us forgiveness of our offences; shelter us in the shelter of your wings; drive from us every foe and enemy; make our life peaceful. Lord, have mercy on us and on your world, and save our souls, for you are good and love mankind.
Then the Priest takes the censer and censes the loaves in the form of a cross, going round the four sides of the table, the Deacon [or Server] going opposite him with the candle.
The Priest, while censing, chants:
Virgin Mother of God, hail Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women; and blessed is the fruit of your womb; for you gave birth to the Saviour of our souls.
DEACON
Let us pray to the Lord.
PEOPLE
Lord, have mercy.
The Priest takes one of the loaves and makes the sign of the Cross over it and says the following prayer aloud:
Prayer of the Breaking of Bread
Lord, Jesus Christ, our God, who blessed the five loaves in the desert, and from them fed five thousand, bless these loaves also, this wheat, wine and oil, and multiply them in this city and in all your world, and sanctify your faithful servants who partake of them. For it is you who bless and sanctify all things, Christ, our God, and to you we give glory, with your Father who is without beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
PEOPLE
Amen.
Then the Priest and Deacon, having kissed one of the loaves, re-enter the Sanctuary, chanting:
Πλούσιοι ἐπτώχευσαν καὶ ἐπείνασαν, οἱ δὲ ἐκζητοῦντες τὸν Κύριον οὐκ ἐλαττωθήσονται παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ.
The Chanters repeat this twice.
2. At Matins
When an Artoklasia is celebrated at Matins, the blessing of loaves takes place at the very end of Matins, that is, immediately after the Doxology.
3. At the end of the Liturgy
Immediately after the Prayer behind the Ambo the Singers begin the Troparion of the Feast or Saint and the Priest and Deacon come from the Sanctuary as above. At the end, after "The rich have become poor ...," the Singers begin "Blessed be the name of the Lord..." as usual; and the Liturgy ends in the normal way. If there is a Memorial Service for the Departed it takes place immediately after "The rich have become poor...," and is followed by "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
Note
Although it is the practice in many parishes to hold the Artoklasia at the end of the Liturgy, we strongly recommend that it takes place either at the end of Vespers, or at the end of the Doxology before the Liturgy.

THE EVLOGITARIA FOR THE DEPARTED
Tone 5.
The choir of Saints has found the source of life and the door of Paradise; may I too find the way through repentance; I am the lost sheep, call me back, O Saviour, and save me.
Of old you formed me from nothing and honoured me with your divine image, but because I transgressed your commandment, you returned me to the earth from which I was taken; bring me back to your likeness, my ancient beauty.
I am an image of your ineffable glory, though I bear the marks of offences; take pity on your creature, Master, and with compassion cleanse me; and give me the longed-for fatherland, making me once again a citizen of Paradise.
Give rest, O God, to your servant(s), and settle him (her/them) in Paradise, where the choirs of the Saints and all the Just shine out like beacons; give rest to your servant(s) who has (have) fallen asleep, overlooking all his (her/their) offences.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
Let us devoutly hymn the threefold light of the one Godhead as we cry: Holy are you, the Father without beginning, the Son likewise without beginning and the divine Spirit; enlighten us who worship you in faith, and snatch us from the everlasting fire.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
