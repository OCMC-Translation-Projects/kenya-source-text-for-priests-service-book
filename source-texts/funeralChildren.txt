Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.  
CHOIR: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You.

At the farewell we sing the following hymns instead of the usual “Let us give a parting farewell...”
 
TONE 8
Who would not lament for you, my child, who art mournfully transported from our life? For while still an infant, untimely from your mother’s arms, like a sparrow’s speedy flight, to the Creator of all you did depart. O child, who cannot grieve when beholding your face visibly fading which before was like a delightful rose?   
 
Who would not sigh and groan, my child, and would not make a tearful sound, at the wealth of your comeliness and the beauty and purity and innocence of your life? For like a sailing boat which leaves no trace behind, you have speedily sailed from my eyes. Come therefore my friends, my kin and neighbours and join with me, and let us give him/her a farewell kiss, as we bear him/her to his/her grave.
 
AT THE GRAVESIDE
The Priest recites the Trisagion for the departed child as in the home.
Before "By the Prayers of our holy fathers" the Priest pours on the body olive oil saying:
PRIEST: Sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Then taking some earth with the shovel he spreads it on the body crosswise, saying:
PRIEST: The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, you art earth and to earth shall you return.
