FUNERAL FOR ALL CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF 7 YEARS OLD, DURING BRIGHT WEEK.
 
When a brother falls asleep in the Lord during Holy Bright Week, we do not sing the usual funeral service, but rather the Resurrection Service. This service is also sung on the day of the leavetaking of the feast of Pascha. During the period after Bright Week until the leavetaking, we sing the usual service but replace “O Holy God, holy and Strong...” with “Christ is risen...”From the home until the temple again we sing “Christ is risen...” Instead of “Let us give a parting farewell...” we sing“Today is the day of Resurrection...”. This is also sung until reaching the grave.

PRIEST: O you O Lord, who does watch over children in the present life, and because of their simplicity of mind and innocence, does reward them in the world to come with a place in Abraham’s bosom and cause them to dwell in bright and radiant places where the souls of the righteous dwell, do you receive in peace the soul of your servant (.....) for you did say: for of such is the Kingdom of heaven.

Jesus having risen from the tomb as He foretold, has granted unto us, life eternal and great mercy.

DEACON: Let us give heed.
READER: Unto you will I cry, O Lord my God.
DEACON: Wisdom.
READER: The reading is from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans. 6: 9-11
DEACON: Let us give heed.
READER: Brethren, Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
PRIEST: Peace unto you.
CHOIR: Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.
DEACON: Wisdom. Stand steadfast. Let us hear the Holy Gospel.
PRIEST: Peace unto all.

PRIEST: At that time, they brought unto Jesus infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.  
CHOIR: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You.

Tone 5
Today is the day of Resurrection, let us be radiant for the festival, and let us embrace one another. Let us say brethren, even to those that hate us: Let us forgive all things on the Resurrection, and thus let us cry aloud:Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.
 
From the temple until the grave is sung: “Today is the day of Resurrection...”
 
AT THE GRAVESIDE
The Priest recites the Trisagion for the departed during Bright Week as in the home.
Before the closing “Christ is risen from the dead...” the Priest pours on the body olive oil saying:
Sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Then taking some earth with the shovel he spreads it on the body crosswise, saying:
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, you art earth and to earth shall you return.
