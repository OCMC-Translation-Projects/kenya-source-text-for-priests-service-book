FUNERAL SERVICE DURING BRIGHT WEEK.
 
When a brother falls asleep in the Lord during Holy Bright Week, we do not sing the usual funeral service, but rather the Resurrection Service. This service is also sung on the day of the leave taking of the feast of Pascha. During the period after Bright Week until the leave-taking, we sing the usual service but replace “O Holy God, holy and  mighty...” with “Christ is risen...” From the home until the temple again we sing “Christ is risen...” Instead of “Let us give a parting farewell...” we sing “Today is the day of Resurrection...”. This is also sung until reaching the grave.
 
THE TRISAGION.

DEACON:	Master, give the blessing.

PRIEST:  Blessed is our God always, now and for ever and to the ages of ages.  

CHOIR: Amen.

PRIEST:  Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.

CHOIR: 	Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life. (2)
Jesus having risen from the tomb as He foretold, has granted unto us, life eternal and great mercy.

DEACON: 	Have mercy upon us, O God, according to your great mercy; we to you, hear us and have mercy.

CHOIR: 	Lord Have mercy.

DEACON: 	Again we pray for the repose of the soul of the departed servant of God [name], who has fallen and for the forgiveness of his/her every transgression, voluntary and involuntary.
Let the Lord God establish his/her soul where the just repose; the mercies of God, the kingdom of the heavens, and the remission of his/her sins, let us beseech of Christ, our immortal King and our God.

CHOIR: 	Grant us, O Lord.

DEACON:	Let us pray unto the Lord.

CHOIR: 	Lord Have mercy.

PRIEST: 	O God of all spirits and of every flesh, who has trampled down death and has overcome the devil, bestowing life to your world; do you yourself, O Lord, give rest to the soul of your departed servant [name] in a place of light, in a place of green pasture, in a place of refreshment, from where pain, sorrow and mourning have fled away. Every sin committed by him/her in thought, word or deed, do you as our good and man-befriending God forgive: for there is no man that shall live and not sin, only you alone are without sin. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is truth.

DEACON:	 Let us pray unto the Lord.

CHOIR: 	Lord Have mercy.

PRIEST: 	For you are the resurrection, the life and the repose of your departed servant [name], who has fallen asleep, O Christ our God, and to you we ascribe glory, together with your eternal Father and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

CHOIR: Amen.

PRIEST:	Glory be to you, O our God, glory be to you.
May He, who is risen from the dead, and by death has overcome death, and to them in the graves has given life, Christ our true God, by the prayers of His most holy Mother; of the holy and all-glorious Apostles; of our holy God-bearing Fathers; and of all the saints, assign to the dwelling place of the righteous the soul of his departed servant (…..) who has departed from us, grant it rest in the bosom of Abraham and number it among the righteous, and may he have mercy upon us, for He is good and loving-kind.
Everlasting be thy memory, O our brother/sister, who is worthy of blessedness and eternal memory. [3]

CHOIR: 	Everlasting be the memory, everlasting be the memory, everlasting be his/her memory.

PRIEST:	Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.
 
From the home until reaching the temple the choir sing slowly:
Christ is risen from the dead, by death he hath overcome death, and to them in the graves hath he given life.
 
 
IN THE TEMPLE.

DEACON:	Master, give the blessing.

PRIEST:	Blessed is our God always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

CHOIR: 	Amen.

PRIEST:	Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.

CHOIR:	Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life. (2).

DEACON:	 Have mercy upon us, O God, according to your great mercy; we pray you, hear us and have mercy.

CHOIR:	Lord Have mercy.

DEACON:	Again we pray for the repose of the soul of the departed servant of God [name], who has fallen asleep and for the forgiveness of his/her every transgression, voluntary and involuntary.
Let the Lord God establish his/her soul where the just repose; the mercies of God, the kingdom of the heavens, and the remission of his/her sins, let us beseech of Christ, our immortal King and our God.

CHOIR:	 Amen.

We then sing the Pascal Katavasia as follows:

ODE 1 TONE 1
The day of Resurrection, let us be radiant, O nations! Pascha, the Lord’s Pascha; for Christ God hath conveyed us from death to life, and from earth to heaven, as we sing the triumphal song.
Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.(x3)
Jesus having risen from the tomb as He foretold, has granted unto us, life eternal and great mercy.

DEACON:	Let us pray unto the Lord.

CHOIR: 	Lord Have mercy.

PRIEST:	For you are the resurrection, the life and the repose of Thy departed servant [name], who has fallen asleep, O Christ our God, and to Thee we ascribe glory, together with your eternal Father and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
 
CHOIR: 	Amen.

If there is more than one Priest, at the end of each ode the Deacon will say “Let us pray to the Lord”  and every priest according to rank will say “For you are the resurrection, the life...”

Christ is risen from the dead...x (3)

And straightway we sing the Exapostilarion
When you slept in flesh as a mortal, O you who are King and Lord, you did rise on the third day, abolishing death and raising Adam from corruption, O Pascha of incorruption, the salvation of the world. (x2)
Then follows the Apostle and Gospel reading of the day. After the Gospel the choir sing:

CHOIR: Glory be to Thee, O Lord, glory be to Thee.

DEACON: Have mercy upon us, O God, according to your great mercy; we pray you, hear us and have mercy.
Again we pray for the repose of the soul of the departed servant of God (name), who has fallen asleep and for the forgiveness of his/her every transgression, voluntary and involuntary.
Let the Lord God establish his/her soul where the just repose; the mercies of God, the kingdom of the heavens, and the remission of his/her sins, let us beseech of Christ, our immortal King and our God.

CHOIR: Lord Have mercy.
PRIEST : O God of all spirits and of every flesh, who didst trample down death and didst overcome the devil, bestowing life to this world; do Thou, O Lord, give rest to the soul of your departed servant (name) in a place of light, in a place of green pasture, in a place of refreshment, from whence pain, sorrow and mourning have fled away. Every sin committed by him/her in thought, word or deed, do Thou as our good and man-befriending God forgive: for there is no man that shall live and not sin, you alone are without sin.

CHOIR: Everlasting be the memory, everlasting be the memory, everlasting be his (her) memory.
PRIEST: Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.
 
Instead of “Let us give a parting farewell...” the choir sing:
Glory… Now and for ever…

Tone 5
Today is the day of Resurrection, let us be radiant for the festival, and let us embrace one another. Let us say brethren, even to those that hate us: Let us forgive all things on the Resurrection, and then let us cry aloud: Christ is risen from the dead, by death he has overcome death, and to them in the graves has he given life.
 
From the temple until the grave is sung: “Today is the day of Resurrection...”
 
AT THE GRAVESIDE
The Priest recites the Trisagion for the departed during Bright Week as in the home.
Before the closing “Christ is risen from the dead...” the Priest pours on the body olive oil saying:

PRIEST: Sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Then taking some earth with the shovel he spreads it on the body crosswise, saying:
PRIEST: The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, you are earth and to earth shall you return.
